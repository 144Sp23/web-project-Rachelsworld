                <p>Bengals are a domestic short hair cat that come from breeding domestic cats with Asian Leopards. This loveable breed is unique because of the spotted or marble pattern that is shown on their coats. Bengals are usually larger in size than the regular house cat, they have long muscular bodys and legs that make them good at jumping and reaching high places. </p>
